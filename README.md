**Static analysis for BPMN 2.0 process models**

## What is it? || Description

Creating valid, standard compliant BPMN 2.0 process models is not trivial. Even when state-of-art modeling tools are used, model often violate some of the constraints stated in the standard document.

BPMNspector checks single files - or complete directories - of BPMN files and reports violations of BPMN 2.0 constraints.

**BPMNspector currently supports:**
- **Schema validation:** Ensures correctness regarding the official OMG XSD files
- **Reference Checking:** Ensures that all used references exist and that only valid types are used
- **Check of Advanced Constraints:**
    - 40 (of 52) constraints defined for the "descriptive conformance sub class" are checked
    - all additional "analytic conformance sub class" constraints are checked
    - 45 (of 50) constraints for the "common executable conformance sub class" are checked
    - 8 (of 12) further constraints for "full conformance sub class" are checked
- **Support of imports:** (resolvable) imports of processes, WSDL and XSD files are also checked

## What do I need? || Requirements 
As BPMNspector uses gradlew only a Java 8 installation is needed - download  and configuration of needed libraries is performed on the fly.

 - JDK 1.8.0 (or higher)
    - JAVA_HOME should point to the jdk directory
    - PATH should include JAVA_HOME/bin

  
## How do I use BPMNspector? || Usage

To use BPMNspector simply run the start script:

```
$ BPMNspector fileToValidate.bpmn
```

After completion a HTML report will be opened automatically - all reports are stored in ```{BPMNspector.home}/reports```.

Available options are listed by calling:
```
$ BPMNspector -h
```

or here:

```
usage: BPMNspector <file or directory> [-c <[opt1[,opt2]...>] [-d] [-h]
       [-o] [-r <NONE | XML | HTML | BOTH>]
Options:
 -c,--checks <[opt1[,opt2]...>   defines which checks should be performed.
                                 Allowed values:
                                 EXT - checks conformance to EXT rules
                                 ALL - performs all checks (default)
                                 REF - checks the correctness of
                                 references
                                 XSD - performs an XML schema validation
 -d,--debug                      run BPMNspector in debug mode
 -h,--help                       prints this usage information
 -o,--open                       open the report file upon completion
 -r <NONE | XML | HTML | BOTH>   defines which report type should be
                                 generated.
                                 Allowed values:
                                 NONE - No report file should be created
                                 XML - create XML reports
                                 HTML - create HTML reports (default)
                                 BOTH - create both report types, XML and HTML

Examples:
		BPMNspector myfile.bpmn
		BPMNspector c:\absolute\path\to\folder -c REF -d
		BPMNspector c:\absolute\path\to\file.bpmn -o -r HTML
```

BPMNspector is partly based on the practical part of two Bachelor theses:
- Andreas has developed the reference checking mechanism ```de.uniba.dsg.bpmnspector.refcheck``` - this part has already been published [here](https://github.com/uniba-dsg/BPMN-Reference-Validator)
- Philipp created the Schematron validation part of BPMNspector ```de.uniba.dsg.bpmnspector.schematron``` - the standalone version is [SchematronBPMNValidator](https://github.com/philippneugebauer/SchematronBPMNValidator)
